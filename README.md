# Medians-of-n-element-lattice

Run the program
add the number of elements of the lattice you have
Write down the lattice as a matrix of 0s and 1s, where 1 is when a<=b

e.g, let the lattice be the square lattice: 0<=1, 0<=2, 1<=3, 2<=3
then the matrix you type is will be:

1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1
0 0 1 1
0 0 0 1
